title: Semester brough to an end
---


Well, that was a pretty rough test to go through and a satisfying end to settle the semester to an end. The class was an intriguing one that focused heavily on fully understanding the semantics of the language and the exact purpose of each of the available functions in C++ and more lightly than usual focus on theory and definitions. While I usually prefer to spend my time in a class writing code, it is nice to have a broader understanding of how the code structures are likely to applied to real world applications, although this class made up for that deficit in bringing in guest speakers to listen to, although they never tied in to the lessons of the class at hand. Overall however, I can confidently say that object-oriented was one of the most exciting classes that I have taken without having to deal with the constant hectic stress of operating systems.
The test in particular, however, was rather unsatisfying. I felt like all the time that I spent studying didnâ€™t mean anything because I expected the test to put most of its focus on abstract classes and handle classes, which I perceive to be the theme of object-oriented programming rather than the data structure classes that more resembled the material we went over in the first midterm. I understand that a student should be prepared for all the material that may appear, but I wish that all of the material we studied for would appear on the midterm, so whatever we studied for, we would be guaranteed to get some credit for our studying.
Tip of the week: talk to employers early in college long before you are ready to graduate
