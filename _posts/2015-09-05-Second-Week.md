title: Bring it on, Collatz
---


A simple mathematical procedure repeated until a certain result appears couldn't be too bad now, could it? Even implementing a cache system to help remember the vast cycle lengths of many of these larger numbers, while certain to be tricky, is a rather straightforward process that will only take a few attempts. Collatz certainly seems to be a rather innocuous assignment if not for the exhausting rules to be followed (just like last time) involving lots of practice GitHub usage, a programming competition website, and something called Travis which I've never heard of and still do not quite understand.

One possible of glimmer of hope might be that I've done the collatz assignment before in Python. Or it would be a glimmer of hope had I not deleted my entire Software Engineering folder to make more room for my disk usage, entirely forgetting that I might be able to reuse the collatz assignment from last time, which means I'll likely have to start all over again to get the cache for collatz working again.

On the bright side of the past week, the reading of the book was a rather enjoyable discussion on the meaning of language. The ways in which languages, while not forcing thoughts to occur, lead certain thoughts be more prevalent than others depending on the what the language is best used for was an aspect of languages that had never occurred to me.

Tip of the day: make sure you have a stupid solution that works before attempting to make a genius solution that works better
