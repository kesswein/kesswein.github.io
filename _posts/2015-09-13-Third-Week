title: First Week, let's go!
---

To little surprise, the overwhelming majority of the difficulty in the first project had to do with the complicated turn-in process, although the process will quite obviously be a valuable experience in the real word of software development. The true tragedy of the week was the 10 pm deadline that caught me completely by surprise which I had the project finished by, but wanted to spend more time seeing if I could beef up the optimization of my cache performance before I went through the final turnin. I ended the assignment with something I had prepared a couple hours before the deadline, unaware of when the deadline actually was.

The high point of the week was definitely the guest speaker from Bloomberg that provided good insight into the world of software development. My props to the speaker for being well spoken and giving a very clear image of the day to day work as well as the overall projects that go about work, all of which are things that I have personally been rather confused about. The speaker did a good job at getting me excited to finish this final year to prepare for some valuable experience. I'm very excited at the prospect  of getting into teams of programmers that think alike to achieve a project that has real world value.

Tip of the day: don't try to reinvent the wheel. Before you start to build a class or function yourself, see if you already have access to a version that already works to your nedds.
