title: Done with the allocator
---

It's nice for things to be quiet once again. No test to cram for, no squeezing in late night project hours, although I didn't spend quite as many late night hours finishing up on the allocator as I originally thought it would take. The allocator was certainly difficult to do, but there was very little work that needed to be done, just some methods to be filled in. However, the low level of work that needed to be done for the third project might make sense for the overall aim of the class. The first two projects were distractions, if difficult ones, that had more focus on basic company software skills while lectures familiarized us with the ground work for object oriented programming. The allocator was the first baby step into actual objected oriented work and was therefore fairly easy. The next two assignments will build off most of the concepts gone over with the allocator and will therefore be much more difficult.

Onto the actual material gone over in the lectures, vectors at last. The code for just the minimal implementation of a vector grew out to be rather long, and I'm fairly aware that vectors can get more complex than what we went over, given the rather long list of methods in the C++ libraries. Going over the details of what differentiated a method from a function was rather interesting given that I had always simply interchanged the terms depending on the language at hand.

Tip of the day: pay attention to your consts; always keep in mind how you want reads and writes to be possible in a method
