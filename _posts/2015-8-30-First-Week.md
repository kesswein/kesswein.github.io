title: First Week, let's go!
---

Hello all, my name is Kevin Esswein and I am fouth year student in Computer Science currently taking CS 371p, Object Oriented Programming, with Professor Glenn Downing. I'm looking forward to an exhaustingly exciting class that will go over new material to expand upon knowledge and skills. I know nothing about C++ other than the fact that almost every single joke about C++ has to do with inheritance, which might be just the reason for it to be chosen as the engine for an object oriented course. 

What to say, what a week! I now know how to make a Hello World program in C++ which is something I didn't know before. I also now know how to calculate collatz which unfortunately is something I did already know before. Given how stressful of a class Software Engineering turned out before, I just had to sign up for Professor Downing again. A worthy trade off however, given that the class moves fast over multiple topics and contains projects full of energy and possibilities. 

I'm hoping that object oriented turns out to down my alley given that it's something I've always thought as a strong point in myself. In times past, I've always enjoyed working with classes, objects, and whatever paths that may go down, but I've been tricked about my imaginary talents before.

Tip of the week: when you aren't sure what's wrong with your program, try to verbally explain the probem to someone else.
