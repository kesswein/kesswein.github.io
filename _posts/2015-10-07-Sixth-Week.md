title: Sixth Week

Since the last week was so quiet I completely forgot to update my Jekyll pages, so here I am starting way too late. It's a nice break focus on learning material that can be expanded upon and examined in depth for programming strategy from the more frantic moments of hastily assembling a program to function with the desired output, efficiency and elegance be damned. 

On the class side of things, it's quite nice to be drifting towards some actual class implementation for dealing with objects. However, unlike starting at the basics of Java-esque implementation which would already be covered by knowledge that the class is already aware of, the lectures went over implementing features I would never have previously considered via the post increment and pre increment, features I thought user defined types would have been unviable for choosing.  The ability of attaching some of C++'s built in functions to the capabilities of a class may not be particularly necessary when dealing with small programs of only a few files, but I suspect may be key to working with large projects and a programmer cannot take the time of keeping track of all of the unique methods of each class that he or she is working with. Conveniently, these classes can also be used with a particular template which allows a user to easily use a specified user defined type within its class variables, further lowering the number of classes a programmer would have to keep up with.

Tip of the day: http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2011/12/15/understanding-lvalues-and-rvalues-in-c-and-c is an article that helped me to better understand pointers and references
