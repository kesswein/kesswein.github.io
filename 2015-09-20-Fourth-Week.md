title: How to vote in Austraila
---

Getting the Australian voting turned out to be easier than expected. Vectors are a rather powerful tool with managing lists of objects of unknown length where information may need can easily be removed from one vector and added to another at will. This made it easy to take the ballots from one voter who was out of a race and give them to another stronger and more popular candidate. After all of the hours my partner and I poured into creating a program that would find us the out and out winner of an election after the first round of votes is cast, it only took a few minutes to create a set of methods that would take the votes of a losing candidate and give them to the next favored candidate. All that's left to do is to create the unit tests, combine the files into making a single file that can be tested by UVA, and handle the usual documentation. And optimize. We could use A LOT of optimization.

Figuring out how pointers and references work, on the other hand, is not so simple. The two seem almost indistinguishable, nearly always having the same impact as eachother with only a few exceptions where they end up behaving differently. The understanding becomes significantly simpler when thinking about where the pointers and references share space with other data blocks on the stack and where they have their own memory.

Tip of the day: never stop talking to your partner; it helps to keep you thinking and helps to keep him/her thinking
